# Breast Cancer Prediction

This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at predicting breast cancer diagnoses using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset. The project utilizes Python and various data science libraries to analyze and predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign.

## Project Overview
The primary goal of this project is to build a predictive model that classifies tumors as malignant or benign based on features extracted from images of fine needle aspirate (FNA) of breast masses. By analyzing cell characteristics, we can use machine learning techniques to assist in early diagnosis.

## Dataset
The dataset used is the [Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data), available on Kaggle. The features represent cell characteristics, while the target label indicates malignancy or benignity.

### Features
- **Mean Radius**: Mean of distances from the center to points on the perimeter
- **Mean Texture**: Standard deviation of gray-scale values
- **Mean Perimeter** and more...

## Installation
To run this project, clone this repository and install the required dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/breast-cancer-prediction.git
cd breast-cancer-prediction
pip install -r requirements.txt
