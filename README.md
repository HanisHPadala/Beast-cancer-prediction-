Project Overview
The primary goal of this project is to build a predictive model that classifies tumors as malignant or benign based on features extracted from images of fine needle aspirate (FNA) of breast masses. By analyzing cell characteristics, we can use machine learning techniques to assist in early diagnosis.

Dataset
The dataset used is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set, available on Kaggle. The features represent cell characteristics, while the target label indicates malignancy or benignity.

Features
Mean Radius: Mean of distances from the center to points on the perimeter
Mean Texture: Standard deviation of gray-scale values
Mean Perimeter and more...
Installation
To run this project, clone this repository and install the required dependencies.

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/breast-cancer-prediction.git
cd breast-cancer-prediction
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Download the Dataset: Use your Kaggle API credentials to download the dataset.

Save your Kaggle API keys to KAGGLE_USERNAME and KAGGLE_KEY environment variables.
Run the script to download and unzip the dataset:
bash
Copy code
!kaggle datasets download -d uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data
!unzip /path/to/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data.zip
Run the Script: Execute the main script to preprocess data, train models, and evaluate their performance.

bash
Copy code
python breast_cancer_prediction.py
Modeling and Evaluation
The model-building process includes:

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, normalizing features, and encoding target labels.
Model Training: Testing several algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Support Vector Machines.
Model Evaluation: Performance is measured using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
